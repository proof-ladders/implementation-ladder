# The crypto implementation verification survey

This project originated at HACS 2025 -- our goal is to compare and contrast different verification
tools, using a curated selection of sample verification problems.

We are strictly concerned with the question of implementation correctness, that is, showing that an
implementation behaves according to its specification.

The sample problems aim to cover a wide range of areas, ranging from mathematics, to formats and
long-lived state and complex APIs.

We are happy to take pull requests!

## Audience

This repository is for vefification-curious folks who want to understand the differences between
tools in concrete terms, rather than from a theoretical perspective.

Tool developers can use this sample set to showcase their approaches, and are welcome to contribute
more solutions and/or problems.
